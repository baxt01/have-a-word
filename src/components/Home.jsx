        <br></br>
        <p>As a group we all have a passion to learn languages. For some of us English isn't our first language, so we decided to create an application that could first translate a word from any language into English, offer an audio pronunciation, then display the words meanings in English, and finally reiterating the words in a quiz for emphasis and clarification.</p>

<p>Our mission was to create an application that would fulfil several needs; a translation tool, an English dictionary and a short quiz to help the user learn. </p>

<p>We Incorporated a translation tool into our application with the idea of helping users who's first language isn't English. The quiz also further aids the user by revisiting the words and their meanings.  This was accomplished by saving the search history of the user and using these words to generate the the short quiz</p>
